Here's a step-by-step explanation of how **backpropagation flows through your neural network** based on the current code:

---

## 🔁 Overview of Network Architecture

```
Input Layer (size: 5)
      ↓
ExciterLayer (R=3 neurons)
      ↓ (1:1 masked)
MaskedLinear (R=3 → 3)
      ↓
Output Layer (3 → 1)
```

## 🔄 Backpropagation Flow

### 1. **Loss Backpropagation Starts**

```python
loss.backward()
```

PyTorch begins the automatic differentiation process. The loss gradient is computed with respect to the network’s output and begins flowing **backward** through each layer.

---

### 2. **Output Layer: Linear(3 → 1)**

* Gradient: `∂Loss/∂output_layer.weight` and `∂Loss/∂output_layer.bias` are computed.
* Then, PyTorch sends gradient `∂Loss/∂hidden_output` backward to the hidden layer.

---

### 3. **MaskedLinear Layer (3 → 3)**

```python
masked_weight = self.weight * self.mask
return F.linear(input, masked_weight, self.bias)
```

* PyTorch computes gradients for the **masked weights** (only diagonal entries are allowed).
* Gradients flow backward through the ReLU, where `∂ReLU/∂x = 1` if `x > 0`, else `0`.
* The resulting gradient `∂Loss/∂exciter_output` is passed to the Exciter layer.

---

### 4. **ExciterFunction.backward()**

This is the custom `backward()` you've defined:

```python
grad_input = grad_output.clone()
grad_input[input < -10.0] = 0
grad_input[input > 10.0] = 0
exciter_layer.custom_backward(grad_output)
return grad_input, None
```

* The `grad_output` is:

  * Cloned.
  * Masked (zeroed out) where input was clamped during `forward()` (outside \[-10, 10]).
* This becomes the `∂Loss/∂exciter_input`, passed back to the linear layer before it.
* Then `exciter_layer.custom_backward(grad_output)` is called.

---

### 5. **ExciterLayer.custom\_backward()**

```python
def custom_backward(self, grad_output):
    ...
    if self.callback_fn:
        self.callback_fn(self, grad_output)
```

* This method can:

  * **Adjust weights/biases manually** using `grad_output`.
  * Trigger **callbacks**, e.g., to probe the network via `get_test_yhat()`.
* These operations are run inside `torch.no_grad()` to avoid contaminating the gradient graph.

---

### 6. **Input Linear Layer (5 → 3)**

* The gradient from the Exciter layer is now passed back to this initial layer.
* PyTorch computes:

  * `∂Loss/∂input_layer.weight`
  * `∂Loss/∂input_layer.bias`
  * And also the gradient w\.r.t the original input `x` if needed (e.g., for adversarial training or saliency maps).

### 🧠 Summary of Backward Path

| Layer                 | Receives Gradient From | Computes              | Notes               |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------- |
| Output Layer          | Loss                   | dLoss/dW, dLoss/db    | Standard PyTorch    |
| MaskedLinear (Hidden) | Output Layer           | Masked weights only   | Only 1:1 paths      |
| ExciterFunction       | Hidden Layer           | dLoss/dExciter output | With clamping logic |
| ExciterLayer          | ExciterFunction        | Custom adjustments    | Calls callback      |
| Input Linear Layer    | ExciterLayer           | Standard backward     | Full connection     |

### ✅ Important Properties

* **Callbacks during backward** allow meta-computation or evaluation (like `get_test_yhat()`).
* **Manual weight updates** (in `custom_backward`) bypass PyTorch optimizers unless explicitly linked.
* **Clamping effects** in Exciter stop gradient flow through saturated inputs.
* **Masking in hidden layer** enforces topology structure during both forward and backward passes.
